# Ethereum Kickstarter Smart Contract with Solidity and Next.js

This is an Ethereum based smart contract application deployed on the Rinkeby Test Network which uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for routing and navigation and [semantic react-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) for nicely styled react components.

## Getting Started

First, navigate to project directory and run

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
to install all dependencies. 

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can find information about the deployed smart contract [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x82621cB279624C96C171C4aBAb066b7611df6F95) via etherscan.io


## Interacting with the application
You will need to install the [Metamask browser extension](https://metamask.io/) and [create an account](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/hello/) in order to create campaigns or contribute to existing campaigns within the application. However, the application can be viewed by anyone in a regular browser without access to Metamask.


## Plans to continue developing from where the turorial left off
I plan to add/tweak a few parts of the application in order to continue to practice with smart contracts and Next.js/React.
- Update the smart contract to the current verison of Solidity.
- Add "name" field for the campaign so they are identifyable by something other than the address.

## Learn More

To learn more about the technologies used in the application, take a look at the following resources:

- [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/)
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
